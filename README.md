DIY Tech MBA

## Intro

At the point in my career 5 years ago where I sort of wished I *had* an MBA, but it would be difficult to *get* an MBA. It would be hard to stop working and get one, hard to find the time to do a part-time one, and felt that the purely online versions were too expensive for the value they were giving you. I don't need help with motivation, and I'm not afraid to read a lot. I wasn't working for a big company, so the traditional way people at this point in my career fund an MBA wasn't an option. So I decided instead to just focus my reading practice towards MBA books. But which ones?

But my focus was on a *Tech* MBA, so it would need all the cores classes but plenty of electives that covered the specific needs of an MBA with technology leadership and management focus.

Where I got my sources:

- GA Tech reading list
- online research
- books that I've found valuable in my career
- personal mba and books like it.
