# DIY Tech MBA

## Introduction

At the point in my career 5 years ago where I sort of wished I *had* an MBA, but it would be difficult to *get* an MBA. It would be hard to stop working and get one, hard to find the time to do a part-time one, and felt that the purely online versions were too expensive for the value they were giving you. I don't need help with motivation, and I'm not afraid to read a lot. I wasn't working for a big company, so the traditional way people at this point in my career fund an MBA wasn't an option. So I decided instead to just focus my reading practice towards MBA books. But which ones?

But my focus was on a *Tech* MBA, so it would need all the cores classes but plenty of electives that covered the specific needs of an MBA with technology leadership and management focus.

Where I got my sources:

- Research of the assigned books of the 3 MBA schools that would be candidates if I was to attend; these schools will remain nameless.
- [Personal MBA book and reading list](https://personalmba.com/)
- [altMBA](https://altmba.com/) [unofficial book list](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/altmba)
- [Basecamp MBA list](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the--basecamp-mba--reading-list/)
- [Random people on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/663vkv/diymba_a_compiled_list_of_19_free_courses_31_books/)
- My own judgement based on a career in tech that started in 2000

## What I'm trying to replicate

An MBA program has:

- Connections / build your network
- Core classes, typically around the following core areas: _______.
- Electives, for your area of focus; for someone going into technology leadership this would likely be entrepreneurship, innovation, or IT project management.
- Note: want to make sure it isn't some Valley focused VC or pure entrepreneurship link of thinking (many DIY Tech MBAs are)
- Capstone project
