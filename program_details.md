## What I'm trying to replicate

An MBA program has:

- Connections / build your network
- Core classes, typically around the following core areas: _______.
- Electives, for your area of focus; for someone going into technology leadership this would likely be entrepreneurship, innovation, or IT project management.
- Note: want to make sure it isn't some Valley focused VC or pure entrepreneurship link of thinking (many DIY Tech MBAs are)
- Capstone project
